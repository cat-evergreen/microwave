This is an (experimental) project to create a new [CREST](https://eveonline-third-party-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) based wormhole mapper. Eventually including a k-space map and fleet tracking options.

### Roadmap:
(subject to change)

* **v0.0.1** User location based (j-)system info (Which class of wormhole am I in?)
    * import SDE to internal db and have a server provide a page to display (static) (j-)system info
    * have CREST auth up, so users can login and get j-system info for their current location

* **v0.?** track connections between j-systems via user tracking and display a basic map (node graph) of such connected systems

* **v1.0.0** A useable WH mapper (includes dynamic system data)

* **v2.0.0** Fleet tracker included (includes k-space maps)
